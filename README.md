🔮 PROJECT PROMPT: Build a Futuristic Developer Terminal CLI with Python

🏗️ Project Title:
FuturTerminal – A safe, futuristic, and developer-focused terminal built in Python.


🎯 Objective:
Build a cross-platform custom terminal CLI tool that combines the aesthetics of a retro-futuristic terminal with developer-friendly utilities. It simplifies modern frontend project setups (React + Tailwind, Next.js + Tailwind), and provides safe, basic terminal commands (like mkdir, cd, touch) without the risk of system damage (no rm, mv, etc.).

This is not just a utility tool, it’s an experience — personalized, interactive, and intuitive.


✨ Core Features:
1. 🧬 ASCII Art Welcome Screen


Beautiful terminal name/logo printed in ASCII


Possibly animated with color transitions (optional)


2. 🎛️ Menu with Dev Shortcuts


Option to:


Scaffold a React + Tailwind project


Scaffold a Next.js + Tailwind project


More features later (Vue, Express, etc.)




It automates:


Running npx


Installing Tailwind with correct flags


Auto-generating tailwind.config.js and injecting code


Running the dev server (npm start or npm run dev)




3. 💻 Basic Terminal Commands (Safe Subset)


mkdir [folder] – Create folders


cd [folder] – Navigate into folders (sandboxed)


ls – Show folder contents


touch [file] – Create empty files


cat [file] – Show file content


pwd – Show current directory


exit – Exit the terminal


All inside a sandboxed root directory so users don’t accidentally wipe system files.


4. 🔐 Safety Measures


No destructive commands (no rm, mv, chmod)


No path access outside the terminal workspace root


Errors and edge cases are handled gracefully


5. 🎨 UX Polish


Colored text and clear logs using colorama or rich


Possibly add sound effects or typing animations


Prompt suggestions and progress indicators

✅ Why This Project is Special


It's practical: Helps frontend devs scaffold projects in seconds.


It's aesthetic: ASCII art, colors, custom CLI experience.


It’s safe: Unlike Linux terminals, there's no way to break your system.


It's resume-worthy: Shows automation, CLI UX, system-level scripting.
